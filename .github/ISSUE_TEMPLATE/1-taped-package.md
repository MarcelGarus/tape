<!-- Welcome to the tape repo! Thanks for filing an issue. Have a cookie! 🍪 -->

Hi, I'm using types from the [<kbd>insert package name</kbd>](https://pub.dev/packages/insert package name) package.

I want to serialize the following types:

- `TypeA`
- `TypeB`

It would be great if a taped-package could be created so that developers who want to use those types don't have to take care of that themselves.
