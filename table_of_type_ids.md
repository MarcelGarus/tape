# The Holy Table of Type IDs

If you are creating a Dart package that needs to register custom type adapters and that's intended to be published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev), don't hesitate to file a pull request adding type ids to this table.

> Consider adding something like the following to your package to allow users to call `binary.initializeMyPackage()`:
>
> ```dart
> extension MyPackageBinary on BinaryApi {
>   void initializeMyPackage() {
>     TypeRegistry.registerAdapters({
>       ...
>     });
>   }
> }
> ```

Type id reservations are done in batches of 10. The x stands for any digit.
